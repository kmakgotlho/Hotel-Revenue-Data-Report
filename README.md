Data Analyst Portfolio: Hotel Booking Analysis

This project showcases a data analyst portfolio featuring hotel booking analysis.

## Overview

Creating a visualization dashboard is part of my day-to-day life. In this article, I will share how I make a dashboard.

When creating a dashboard, I spend approximately 60% of my time planning and 40% on the development, testing, and implementation. However, this may vary depending on the complexity. Moreover, I use the Agile methodology when the stakeholders do not know what they want or need. When I say Agile, it means to create a dashboard with current known requirements, let the user test it to elicit more requirements, recreate the dashboard with newly identified requirements, and iterate the process until an optimal dashboard is achieved.

## Process

1. **Define the Problem:** Understand the problem and the role of the dashboard in solving it.
2. **Gather Requirements:** Identify the needs to solve the problem and decompose these into requirements.
3. **Data Planning:** Determine what, where, and how to acquire the data needed. Clean the data as necessary.
4. **Develop the Dashboard:** Create the dashboard based on the requirements, ensuring proper visuals and accuracy.
5. **Testing:** Empower stakeholders to provide feedback and ensure the dashboard meets their requirements.
6. **Implementation:** Provide a walkthrough on how to use the dashboard and address all questions and comments.

## Application Example

Let's apply these steps to create a PowerBi dashboard using the Hotel dataset.

### Define the Problem

The hotel wants to understand their revenue per year. As a data consultant, I am tasked to investigate this issue and answer the following questions:
- Is the hotel revenue growing by year? segment revenue by hotel type
- Should they increase their parking lot size? Show trends in guests with personal cars.
- What trends can they see in the data? Focusing on average daily rates and guests to explore personality

### Gather Requirements

Determine the primary hotel type and calculate revenue.

### Data Planning

Acquire sales and financial data from the company's central data repository. Use SQL to retrive only needed data.

### Dashboarding

Create a dashboard 
- Visualize revenue of both hotel types.
 Percentages of cars that have parked within hotel

### Testing

Allow stakeholders to test the dashboard and use their feedback to improve it.

### Implementation

Transition the dashboard to end-users, provide a walkthrough tutorial, and document instructions.

## Conclusion

The SQL codes used to query and analyze the data can be found in the [SQL-Codes](./SQL-Codes) folder.
